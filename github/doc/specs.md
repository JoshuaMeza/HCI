## Project definition

### Description

This project is aiming to fight, or at least reducing, the negative effects on peopleâ€™s mental health that social isolation has caused during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as stress, anxiety, sadness, among others.

After doing some research, it was found some therapeutical activities that could be of benefit as stress relievers, such as creating art (e.g., drawing), sharing experiences (e.g., writing or talking with other people), having a healthy lifestyle (e.g., doing exercise and having a balanced diet), and trying receptive music therapy (this includes some kinds of music, Ambiental sounds, and voices). Besides, the survey gave indicators of which of them are the preferred ones and that a technological approach would be appreciated.

The project consists of developing a mobile application that simulates using a diary, with the option of reproducing music, sharing your thoughts with other people, and having special interactions with the written pages, all for letting and helping people to express their feelings and finally relive their burdens.

It is important to clarify that the proposal is a complementary activity that is not replacing a professional therapy or counseling service.

### Problematic

Mental health problems due to social isolation, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Target users

The target from this proyect are college students with a deteriortion in their academic performances due to emotional exhaustion or stress.

### Objectives

Although there are multiple applications that are made to tackle feelings of stress and depression like Headspace and Dare, they normally have audio guides and textual sources to read but this does not include a therapeutic way to ventilate about your own feelings by writing or drawing, and on the market there are certain cons that can propose a problem which is not to be completely informed on these subjects, this application wants to overcome these problems so people can have a better way of letting go their negative feelings to make them feel better and have a good response on the people in a therapeutic way.

## Personas

For this project we are using the Personas method to get to know more closely our target public, so, keeping that in mind, we specially need solve the following questions:

- What do we expect for a solution?
- When and how would they like to use a solution?
- How much important is privacy for them?

### Desired attributes

#### Persona's Biographic Background

First, we need to know about the persona's backstory, how they are, what they do, and their online usage, so these are the attributes that we selected:

- Age
- Education
- Attitudes
- Tenure of online usage
- Type of usage

#### Specific Goals/Needs/Attitudes

People want to achieve something in their lives, and as for technology, people have different ways to work with it as well as how they act with it, so we need these attributes:

- Frustrations
- Attitude towards technology used
- How is value defined?

#### Context of Usage

People's ways to use the technology varies from others and their personalities, attitudes and environment can affect that on how they use technology:

- Surrounding environment
- Confidentiality/Privacy
- Satisfaction

#### Interaction Characteristics of Usage

We need to know the times people use technology:

- Frequency of use

#### Sensory/Immersive Characteristics of Usage

We also need attributes that can relate on what sort of thoughs people feel about technology:

- Mood/Feeling
- Pleasurable

### Research methods

#### Interview with experts

#### Avaliability:

- People can use the diary whenever need to, so it needs to be always available.

#### Portable:

- The application should be accessible in different operating systems, such as Android and iOS.

#### Scalability:

- The application should have updates at least once per month.

#### Usability:

- People must be able to understand how to use the application by intuition, they are not supposed to spend more than 20 seconds to find where to access to any of the most representative features, starting in the principal menu, during their first-time use.

#### Security:

- Only the user can access to their recorded experiences.
- The information must always be encrypted, to guarantee the privacy of the user.
- The user can share their pages if they want to.
