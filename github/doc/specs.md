## Project definition

### Description

This project is aiming to fight, or at least reducing, the negative effects on peopleâ€™s mental health that social isolation has caused during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as stress, anxiety, sadness, among others.

After doing some research, it was found some therapeutical activities that could be of benefit as stress relievers, such as creating art (e.g., drawing), sharing experiences (e.g., writing or talking with other people), having a healthy lifestyle (e.g., doing exercise and having a balanced diet), and trying receptive music therapy (this includes some kinds of music, Ambiental sounds, and voices). Besides, the survey gave indicators of which of them are the preferred ones and that a technological approach would be appreciated.

The project consists of developing a mobile application that simulates using a diary, with the option of reproducing music, sharing your thoughts with other people, and having special interactions with the written pages, all for letting and helping people to express their feelings and finally relive their burdens.

It is important to clarify that the proposal is a complementary activity that is not replacing a professional therapy or counseling service.

### Problematic

Mental health problems due to social isolation, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Target users

The target from this proyect are college students with a deteriortion in their academic performances due to emotional exhaustion or stress.

### Objectives

Although there are multiple applications that are made to tackle feelings of stress and depression like Headspace and Dare, they normally have audio guides and textual sources to read but this does not include a therapeutic way to ventilate about your own feelings by writing or drawing, and on the market there are certain cons that can propose a problem which is not to be completely informed on these subjects, this application wants to overcome these problems so people can have a better way of letting go their negative feelings to make them feel better and have a good response on the people in a therapeutic way.

## Personas

For this project we are using the Personas method to get to know more closely our target public, so, keeping that in mind, we specially need solve the following questions:

- What do we expect for a solution?
- When and how would they like to use a solution?
- How much important is privacy for them?

### Desired attributes

#### Persona's Biographic Background

First, we need to know about the persona's backstory, how they are, what they do, and their online usage, so these are the attributes that we selected:

- Age
- Education
- Attitudes
- Tenure of online usage
- Type of usage

#### Specific Goals/Needs/Attitudes

People want to achieve something in their lives, and as for technology, people have different ways to work with it as well as how they act with it, so we need these attributes:

- Frustrations
- Attitude towards technology used
- How is value defined?

#### Context of Usage

People's ways to use the technology varies from others and their personalities, attitudes and environment can affect that on how they use technology:

- Surrounding environment
- Confidentiality/Privacy
- Satisfaction

#### Interaction Characteristics of Usage

We need to know the times people use technology:

- Frequency of use

#### Sensory/Immersive Characteristics of Usage

We also need attributes that can relate on what sort of thoughs people feel about technology:

- Mood/Feeling
- Pleasurable

### Research methods

#### Interview with experts

This method consists of interviewing people with specialized knowledge on the subject to be investigated, its implementation is very useful to acquire a lot of information in a short amount of time, in addition to the fact that the information comes from a reliable source. In this type of interview it is recommended to structure it previously, for having a guide script and making accurate questions, reducing the margin of error when applying it and making possible collecting the information that you need, since it must be taken into account that the experts will not necessarily be available 24/7.

In the case of our project, we used this research method to collect information about the problematic and have guidance about what we needed to keep in mind during the definition of the solution. The following questions were applied for the interview with the Psychologist Alejandro Herrera GonzÃ¡lez:

- From your point of view, what have been the reasons for the recent increase in mental health cases in university students?
- What do you consider to be the best alternative treatment options to therapy when this cannot become a possibility for a patient?
- Investigating, we found that the writing of traumatic experiences can generate positive effects in overcoming them in the medium term, do you consider it a viable option for this problem?
- Do you consider technology to be a tool that can help in this type of situation? why?
- Do you know psychological help apps or websites? Which? To what do you think your success or failure is due?
- If you could use a tool to help your patients with complementary activities to therapy sessions, what would the tool do?
- What aspects should we always keep in mind when building the solution?
- Is there any difficulty that you think could harm the development of the project?
- How should the solution be tested once it is done? Taking into account ethical factors.
- Is there any additional advice or insight you'd like to offer in closing?

As a conclusion, from this interview we managed to clarify certain difficulties that we will contemplate in the project, because initially we wanted to guide the project to treat patients with psychological problems such as depression or anxiety using a technological approach, however, the psychologist mentioned to us that a very important point to treat this type of diseases is human interaction. Moreover, let us remember that the psychological problems in students began with the social isolation and the little contact they had with their peers, and although contact continued to exist virtually, this does not replace a one-on-one interaction with other students or teachers. Nevertheless, technology can serve as a complementary aid to maintain a good mental health, alleviate the exhausting caused by information oversaturation and stress. In these times it is very common for college students to have at least one smart device in their homes or pockets, so, it is a means that we can use to reach and help them. Finally, it should be mentioned that confidentiality must be one of our top priorities when presenting a solution, because the information on this type of problem can be sensitive.

#### Sources of information

To start thinking about a solution proposal, we took on the task of investigating what are those activities that can help us when we feel bad about a situation or we are under too much stress, we know that there can be an infinity of activities that can help us to improve the situation, but on this occasion we decided to investigate the 4 that have presented the best results when they are carried out by the person, another thing to take into account is their implementation in digital media, since some activities can be complicated to be applied in a digital format because it requires social interaction between people for its implementation, and as we mentioned before, we do not seek to replace social activities due to their importance in the treatment of these diseases.

- Writing: It is a great type of therapy that helps people organize their ideas, detect what is causing them problems, bring to light their hidden emotions and thoughts and confront them at their own pace.
- Music: Receptive music therapy consists of listening to music, environmental sounds or voices to reduce the effects of physical or mental illnesses. Music has been shown to be good for reducing stress and sadness.
- Painting: Art therapy consists of helping a person to finally relax while creating a work of art, facilitating the process and the release of their emotions. Activities such as painting and coloring have been shown to reduce people's stress levels exponentially.
- Healthy lifestyle: A poor diet is directly related to mental health problems. Maintaining a good diet combined with exercise can be an effective, attractive and low-cost therapeutic resource for the treatment of these problems.
