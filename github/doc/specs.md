## Project definition

### Description

This project is aiming to fight, or at least reducing, the negative effects on peopleâ€™s mental health that social isolation has caused during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as stress, anxiety, sadness, among others.

After doing some research, it was found some therapeutical activities that could be of benefit as stress relievers, such as creating art (e.g., drawing), sharing experiences (e.g., writing or talking with other people), having a healthy lifestyle (e.g., doing exercise and having a balanced diet), and trying receptive music therapy (this includes some kinds of music, Ambiental sounds, and voices). Besides, the survey gave indicators of which of them are the preferred ones and that a technological approach would be appreciated.

The project consists of developing a mobile application that simulates using a diary, with the option of reproducing music, sharing your thoughts with other people, and having special interactions with the written pages, all for letting and helping people to express their feelings and finally relieve their burdens.

It is important to clarify that the proposal is a complementary activity that is not replacing a professional therapy or counseling service.

### Problematic

Mental health problems due to social isolation, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Target users

The target from this proyect are college students with a deteriortion in their academic performances due to emotional exhaustion or stress.

### Objectives

Although there are multiple applications that are made to tackle feelings of stress and depression like Headspace and Dare, they normally have audio guides and textual sources to read but this does not include a therapeutic way to ventilate about your own feelings by writing or drawing, and on the market there are certain cons that can propose a problem which is not to be completely informed on these subjects, this application wants to overcome these problems so people can have a better way of letting go their negative feelings to make them feel better and have a good response on the people in a therapeutic way.

### Feasibility

### Design process

For this project, we are using User Centered Design as our design process. The _Interaction Design Foundation_ (n.d.) describes it as:

> User-centered design (UCD) is an iterative design process in which designers focus on the users and their needs in each phase of the design process. In UCD, design teams involve users throughout the design process via a variety of research and design techniques, to create highly usable and accessible products for them. ([User Centered Design](<https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/user-centered-design#:~:text=User%2Dcentered%20design%20(UCD),and%20accessible%20products%20for%20them>))
