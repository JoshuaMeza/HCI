## Project definition

### Description

This project is aiming to fight, or at least reducing, the negative effects on peopleâ€™s mental health that social isolation has caused during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as stress, anxiety, sadness, among others.

After doing some research, it was found some therapeutical activities that could be of benefit as stress relievers, such as creating art (e.g., drawing), sharing experiences (e.g., writing or talking with other people), having a healthy lifestyle (e.g., doing exercise and having a balanced diet), and trying receptive music therapy (this includes some kinds of music, Ambiental sounds, and voices). Besides, the survey gave indicators of which of them are the preferred ones and that a technological approach would be appreciated.

The project consists of developing a mobile application that simulates using a diary, with the option of reproducing music, sharing your thoughts with other people, and having special interactions with the written pages, all for letting and helping people to express their feelings and finally relieve their burdens.

It is important to clarify that the proposal is a complementary activity that is not replacing a professional therapy or counseling service.

### Problematic

Mental health problems due to social isolation, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Target users

The target from this proyect are college students with a deteriortion in their academic performances due to emotional exhaustion or stress.

### Objectives

Although there are multiple applications that are made to tackle feelings of stress and depression like Headspace and Dare, they normally have audio guides and textual sources to read but this does not include a therapeutic way to ventilate about your own feelings by writing or drawing, and on the market there are certain cons that can propose a problem which is not to be completely informed on these subjects, this application wants to overcome these problems so people can have a better way of letting go their negative feelings to make them feel better and have a good response on the people in a therapeutic way.

### Feasibility

#### Innovation

There are multiple applications that are made to tackle the feelings of stress and depression like Headspace and Dare.
Typically, those applications only include audio guides and textual sources to read from. but they don't include a therapeutic way to ventilate about your problems by writing, drawing and listening to relaxing music (and more) while you're doing it.
You don't really get to take out any of the feelings you're going through, which is beneficial for helping overcome them. You can't feel better until you ventilate about what you're going through.
All these things combined offer a different experience than those already included in the already-existing applications on the market.

#### Motivation

From what we have in the market there are some certain cons that can propose a problem, like not being completely informed on these subjects or not proposing a good solution that can benefact the people.
It is a fact that not letting go of the feelings you keep inside would aggravate people situations even more like a snowball effect, this solution offers a more useful vision of what could cause this negative feelings as well as helping people feel more relaxed and less stressful in their lives.

#### Relevance

Mental health problems have unfortunately become frequent ailments, the pandemic and the drastic change in social life have led to this situation. Many people still stigmatize depression and think that it is not a big deal, downplays it and sometimes makes people who experience it decide not to say anything, in addition to the fact that there is a great lack, both in the university and outside it, of organizations concerned about the situation.
This is not a substitute for professional care, but it does offer an alternative for times when you don't have, or no one is available to you.

### Design process

For this project, we are using User Centered Design as our design process. The _Interaction Design Foundation_ (n.d.) describes it as:

> User-centered design (UCD) is an iterative design process in which designers focus on the users and their needs in each phase of the design process. In UCD, design teams involve users throughout the design process via a variety of research and design techniques, to create highly usable and accessible products for them. ([User Centered Design](<https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/user-centered-design#:~:text=User%2Dcentered%20design%20(UCD),and%20accessible%20products%20for%20them>))

You can find the information about each phase in the following list:
