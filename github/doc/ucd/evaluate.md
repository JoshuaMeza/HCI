## Testing phase

### Objectives

The main objectives of doing the testing are:

- Evaluate how the target public feels while using the application.
- Determine if the users are comfortable with the UI proposed.
- Find possible opportunities of improvement.

### Metrics

The metrics considered for evaluating the data to be gathered are:

- Single ease question
- System usability scale
- Effectiveness rate of performing tasks
- Average duration
- Misclick Rate

The first three metrics were explored into more detail in the [Metric Draft](https://alumnosuady-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/a16000959_alumnos_uady_mx/EZXQc20Onw1KkheW2tqq6m4B9yEiKWcCJlBuWRKOKRAL3A?e=zLSz6o) document, that was generated in the last phase, and the last two have been added to make easier the activity of processing the data.

### Planning

Once the objectives were assigned and the metrics were found, the next step was defining the application process to be used. You can see it with more detail in the [Testing application guide](https://alumnosuady-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/a16000959_alumnos_uady_mx/ESGPoZl0wRRPuhbuFTWCn3MB5CuLhdJFFJ_eChnVi3wuNA?e=BjRXHW).

### Tools

The materials needed for testing are:

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) (software for designing and prototyping)
- [Maze](https://app.maze.co/) (software built for testing)
- [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) (software for recording)
- [Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel)
- Computer with internet connection, a mouse, and a keyboard

### Application

#### Pilot

The first testing application was made with one person by using the [mid fidelity prototype v2.0.0](https://www.figma.com/proto/40ex0p1mRFTtfvaGVpVyd1/HCI_Design?node-id=72%3A435&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=67%3A434&starting-point-node-id=72%3A435). Then, with the feedback obtained, the team developed an upgraded version of that view. The video can be found in the [Testing evidence](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI1RNehmmnPBXbTUCAnueC9iAZp5UvSH7) playlist.

#### Final

The second testing application was made with 9 people by using the [mid fidelity prototype v2.1.0](https://www.figma.com/proto/40ex0p1mRFTtfvaGVpVyd1/HCI_Design?node-id=126%3A1344&scaling=scale-down&page-id=126%3A1003&starting-point-node-id=126%3A1344) and the software Maze. The videos can be found in the [Testing evidence](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI1RNehmmnPBXbTUCAnueC9iAZp5UvSH7) playlist

### Results

The results of the last testing were the following:

| Metrics                                | First task | Second Task | Third task | Fourth task |
| :------------------------------------- | :--------: | :---------: | :--------: | :---------: |
| Single ease question                   |   6.4/7    |    5.3/7    |   6.7/7    |    6.7/7    |
| Effectiveness rate of performing tasks |    100%    |    100%     |    100%    |    100%     |
| Average duration                       |   33.5 s   |   51.8 s    |    30 s    |   27.9 s    |
| Misclick Rate                          |   11.1%    |    10.4%    |   16.7%    |     N/A     |

> Misclick Rate in the last task is not taken in account because of the way it was implemented, it generated a huge percentage that doesn't adjust to reality.

The results of the System usability scale metric can be found [here](https://alumnosuady-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/a16001575_alumnos_uady_mx/ET1a_qFwW6BIrwBNmgvH3bQB_8Gry3Wzpj0IbIaLthXpIQ?e=04cGZw).

### Conclusions

At the very end, after analyzing the information and the feedback gave by the testers, some users felt that the tutorial section needs to be improved, because some instructions were confusing; another thing is that there were functionalities that should be moved into another place, the perfect example is the share button of the activities, that everyone agreed that the second task could be much easier if that option was directly inside the activity window; and finally, some icons caused misunderstandings to some users because they were incorrectly used or had inadequate colors.
